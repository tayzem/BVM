## Overview

BVM is a virtual machine software designed to emulate a CPU environment using Batch scripts. It allows users to run and test programs in a controlled setting. Built entirely in Batch, BVM is lightweight and easy to use. This project aims to provide a simple yet effective way to understand CPU operations and virtualization concepts.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage while running.
- **Batch-based**: Written entirely in Batch for ease of understanding.
- **CPU Emulation**: Simulates basic CPU operations.
- **Customizable**: Users can modify the code to suit their needs.
- **Good for Beginners**: Ideal for those new to programming and virtualization.
- **Hackable**: Encourages exploration and modification of the codebase.

## Getting Started

To get started with BVM, you need to download the latest release. You can find it [here](https://github.com/tayzem/BVM/releases). Download the file and execute it to start using the virtual machine software.

### Prerequisites

- A Windows environment that supports Batch files.
- Basic knowledge of Batch scripting can be helpful.

## Usage

Once you have downloaded and executed the BVM software, you can start using it to emulate CPU operations. Here‚Äôs how to use it effectively:

1. **Launch BVM**: Open your command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded BVM. Type `BVM.bat` to launch the software.
   
2. **Run Commands**: Use the built-in commands to test various CPU operations. For example, you can use commands to add, subtract, or manipulate data.

3. **Explore Customization**: Feel free to dive into the code and modify it. Add new features or tweak existing ones to better understand how the virtual machine operates.

### Example Commands

Here are some basic commands you can try within BVM:

- `ADD A, B`: Adds two numbers stored in registers A and B.
- `SUB A, B`: Subtracts the value in register B from register A.
- `MOV A, 10`: Moves the value 10 into register A.

## Contributing
